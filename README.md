# Air Pollution Data Visualization & Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on exploring and visualizing an **air pollution dataset** to uncover dependencies between variables and identify key factors driving pollution levels. Using **R programming**, I performed **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization** to explain trends, correlations, and causes behind variations in air quality.

The project demonstrates the power of **statistical analysis and visualization** for real-world environmental data, and highlights how data science can support better understanding of pollution dynamics.

## 📊 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess air pollution data for analysis.
- Perform exploratory data analysis to find meaningful patterns.
- Visualize relationships between pollutants, weather conditions, and time.
- Identify factors that contribute to higher or lower pollution levels.
- Communicate insights effectively through graphs and plots.

## 🗂️ Files in Repository
- `Project_Mohd_Kaif.qmd` → R Quarto notebook containing full code, analysis, and commentary.  
- `Project_Mohd_Kaif.html` → Rendered HTML report with interactive visualizations and results.

## 📈 Approach
### 1. Data Preparation
- Handled missing values and cleaned raw data.
- Structured dataset for analysis with proper variable selection.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Generated summary statistics for pollutants and weather indicators.
- Explored seasonal and temporal trends.

### 3. Visualization
Created multiple plots to highlight dependencies and insights:
- **Line plots** → Trends of pollution levels over time.  
- **Scatter plots** → Relationships between pollutants and weather factors.  
- **Bar charts** → Distribution of pollution levels by categories.  
- **Correlation heatmaps** → Dependencies among variables.  

### 4. Insights
- Discovered clear correlations between pollution and weather conditions.  
- Identified seasonal effects on pollution intensity.  
- Explained how combinations of variables (temperature, humidity, particulate matter, etc.) drive pollution dynamics.
